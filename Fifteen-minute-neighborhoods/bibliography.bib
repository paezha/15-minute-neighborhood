   abstract = {Problem: When the First National Conference on City Planning took place in Washington, DC, 100 ago, the delegates failed to foresee the consequences of automobility and suburbanization, but in other ways they were remarkably prescient. They stressed the importance of the linkage between transportation and land use, understood that transportation facilities must be harmoniously embedded in the urban fabric, and viewed transportation investment as a way to direct growth, revitalize flagging areas, and link jobs and housing. Since transportation planners in subsequent decades kept this vision alive, envisioning a network of context-sensitive urban freeways fully integrated into the urban milieu, why is this not what was built? Purpose: We consider the history of U.S. urban transportation planning over the past 100 years, to explain the evolution and legacy of the single most important transportation development of the past century save automobility itself: the emergence of the urban freeway. Methods: We reviewed primary and secondary material, including plans, manuscripts, newspaper accounts, and scholarly articles and books. Results and conclusions: We argue that the method used to fund interstate highway development put federal and state highway engineers in charge, and this affected highways' location and design. State highway engineers imposed a narrow, traffic-service-oriented vision on metropolitan freeways that focused on maximizing vehicle throughput and largely ignored other urban concerns. With too little advance thought, overbuilt, sparse, ring-radial networks were routed through neighborhoods in cities around the country, often at great social and environmental cost. Though the system has undeniably conferred great benefits in terms of enhanced mobility, the costs have been high as well. Recent years have seen a return to the early planners' perspective, stressing the social, environmental, and aesthetic impacts of transportation facilities and interactions with land use. Takeaway for practice: A century-old vision of coordinated transportation and land use planning has resurfaced in practice, but in the meantime politically expedient decisions about public finance have had unanticipated, but profound and long-lasting effects on projects, travel, and urban form. Research support: Portions of this research were funded by the University of California Transportation Center and the University of California, Los Angeles Academic Senate.},

   abstract = {A sufficient number of studies have highlighted that walkable neighborhoods can help to reduce the risk of obesity and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The Chinese government advocates the 15-minute (15-min) walkable neighborhoods to provide citizens with 15-min walkable access to basic public services, and ultimately to improve walking behavior and overall health. Following the Walk Score metric, this paper proposes a modified method for measuring 15-min walkable neighborhoods and applies it to Shanghai, China. Based on amenity access, the assessment considers walking demands of different pedestrian groups (i.e., the entire population, children, adults, and seniors), the amenity attributes (scale and category), and the real traffic conditions. Spatial regression is further performed to determine whether significant associations exist between community socioeconomic status and 15-min walkable neighborhoods score. Results show clear variations in 15-min walkable neighborhoods score for different pedestrian groups. Regarding the overall 15-min walkable neighborhoods, highly walkable communities are primarily concentrated in the central areas; and that poorly walkable communities are dispersed in rural areas. Senior-concentrated and adult-concentrated communities are more likely to present higher walkability, while children-concentrated communities exhibit lower walkability. Moreover, communities with inferior walkability are characterized by a high proportion of floating population (nonresidents). This research provides future studies with references for evaluating 15-min walkable neighborhoods. Social inequalities in 15-min walkable neighborhoods should be emphasized, and interventions in planning implementation for building healthy communities in China should be targeted.},
